# Euler
These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) challenges. As of right now I've created solutions to puzzles 1 to 20.

These solutions were created during my first and second semester. Some files contain multiple solutions in an attempt to find a more efficient solution. Some of these new solutions were written using existing pseudo code.
